I love learning new things and spend a lot of time reading books, listening to podcasts, parsing newsletters, doing side projects etc. 
As I consume all of this content, I make notes, create bookmarks, store screenshots, etc. and over time all of these have become
distributed across apps, devices, accounts, etc. Instead from now on, I'll migrate any new notes and content as a blog post here, with the 
aim to summarize it in two to five sentences or bullet points (might not be as easy for books). 

I do this primarily to serve as a quick reference for myself and for you - so you can benefit from my learnings and add
to it as well.

I'll keep updating the site with new blogs and capabilities such as ability for you to comment and share whether you found the content 
useful and worth your time.
